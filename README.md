#Steps To Follow

1. **Download MATLAB 2013:**
   - You'll need to obtain the MATLAB 2013 installer from the MathWorks website. You may need a MathWorks account to access the download.

2. **Install MATLAB:**
   - Once you've downloaded the installer, run it and follow the on-screen instructions to install MATLAB on your system. During the installation process, make sure to install it on the `C:` drive.

3. **Locate MATLAB Installation Directory:**

   - Create a new folder within the `bin` directory. You can name it according to your preference.

5. **Put Your Code in the New Folder:**
   - Copy or move your MATLAB code files to the newly created folder inside the `bin` directory. This is where you'll store your MATLAB code files.

6. **Run MATLAB:**
   - You can now run MATLAB 2013 version on your system.
   - To execute your MATLAB code, open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you placed your code files. You can then run your MATLAB scripts or functions from within MATLAB's command window or editor.
